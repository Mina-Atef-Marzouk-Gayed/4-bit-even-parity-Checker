## 🧾 What is Even Parity?  
Even parity is a simple **error detection method**.  
- If the number of 1s in a 4-bit input is **even**, the parity bit = **0**.  
- If the number of 1s is **odd**, the parity bit = **1**.  

This ensures the total number of 1s is always **even**, helping detect single-bit errors during transmission.
